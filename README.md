## Overview
This assignment covers:
1. Pick-and-Place Robot (MDP Design)
2. 2×2 Gridworld (Value Iteration by Hand)
3. 5×5 Gridworld (Synchronous & In-Place Value Iteration)
4. Off-Policy Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling

---

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/akondeti7046/assignment-1_RL.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

---

## Usage
Run the notebook:

\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook
\`\`\`

Open \`assignment 1 RL.ipynb\` or the exported \`assignment 1 RL.html\` and run all cells sequentially.

---

## Results Summary
- Value Iteration converges in ~9 sweeps and gives exact results.
- Monte Carlo Off-Policy requires thousands of episodes and is approximate.
- Both methods yield similar policies near the goal.
